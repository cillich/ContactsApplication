# Contacts Application

This is a personal project to learn more about developing web applications with MEAN stack. Once finished, the application will allow users to add contacts with a name, email, and phone number. The contacts will be stored in a database.

## Set up

`npm install`

## To Run the Server

`node server`

## Future Enhancements

1. Add functionality to put in new contacts (rather than dummy information in the database)
2. Add functional and structural tests
3. Figure out how to let other people download ContactsApp without having to install MongoDB
