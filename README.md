# Contacts Application

This is a personal project to learn more about developing web applications with MEAN stack. Once finished, the application will allow users to add contacts with a name, email, and phone number. The contacts will be stored in a database.

## Set up

Install Node.js into your directory:

`npm install`

Because I am not hosting a database for this application, you have to install MongoDB yourself. Use these links to help set it up:

For Mac: https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-os-x/
For Windows: https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-windows/

You will have to create a database called "contactlist".

## To Run the Server

`node server`

## Future Enhancements

Add functional and structural tests
