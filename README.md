# Contacts Application

This is a personal project to learn more about developing web applications with MEAN stack. Once finished, the application will allow users to add contacts with a name, email, and phone number. The contacts will be stored in a database. 

## To Run the Server

`node server`

## Future Enhancements

1. Add MongoDB to store contacts in a database
2. Add functionality to put in new contacts (rather than dummy information)
3. Add functional and structural tests
